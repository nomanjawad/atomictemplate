i want a specific rules for file and folder naming

case used :

kebab-case
camelCase
PascalCase

`consider a file if it have token separated by "." and have an extension` do not consider all as folder

inside a folder if there is another folder that means its a group folder. 

for global naming file/ folder name should lower kebab case normally

if file and folder have multiple folder then use kebab case

folder wise naming

in `app` folder
file or folder should be lower case. any multi word file or folder should be named in lower kebab case for url path

components folder
it contains more folder to group components
like atoms, molecules , organisms etc
