# ESLint Rules

This project includes a few simple rules to keep names, folders, and headings consistent.

Read each rule:

- component-hook-name-match: `./rules/component-hook-name-match.md`
- file-naming-rules: `./rules/file-naming-rules.md`
- require-index-file: `./rules/require-index-file.md`
- heading-rules: `./rules/heading-rules.md`
- import-path-rules: `./rules/import-path-rules.md`
- import module-rules: `./rules/import-module-rules.md`

How to use

- The rules are already enabled in `eslint.config.mjs`.
- Some rules have options you can change there.
